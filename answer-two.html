        <div>Frederick's journey teaches us to never give up in the face of adversity. 
            <br />Frederick Douglass once famously said <b>"if there is nostruggle ther is no progress. Thos who profess to favor freedom and yetdepriciate agitation
            are men who want crop without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunder and lightening, they want the ocean without the awful Wars of its many waters
            .This struggle may be a moral one or it may be both moral and physical but it must be a struggle"</b>
